# Thource's Minimap Mod
Thource's Minimap Mod adds a detailed minimap to Wurm Unlimited.

## Requirements
- As with most WU mods, this mod depends on [Ago's mod loader](https://forum.wurmonline.com/index.php?/topic/134945-released-client-mod-loader).

## Installation
1. Download the latest version from https://github.com/Thource/thources-minimap-mod/releases/latest
2. Extract the contents of `thources-minimap-mod.zip` into your Wurm Unlimited `mods` folder.

## Usage
The minimap can be opened and closed with the `Minimap` button on the `esc` menu.

There are also some console commands, open the console with F1 and type any of the following:

*Note: All commands must be prefixed with `minimap`, for example: `minimap toggle`.*
